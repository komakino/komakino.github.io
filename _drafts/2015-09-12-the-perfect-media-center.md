## Ideal scenario
- Put on TV
- See new available episodes of my favorite shows
- See movies I added to watchlists on iMDB and trakt.tv
- Instantly stream all of the above.

## Hardware
I acctually run the same setup on several machines, including a Raspberry Pi B and an Asrock ION 330. The Pi is on the slow side CPU wise, but the GPU handles HD video with no problem, so it does what it needs to do. I'll probably get a Pi 2 soon.

## Software
Well, Kodi of course. If you never heard of Kodi, you have probably heard of XBMC, which is what it used to be called.
