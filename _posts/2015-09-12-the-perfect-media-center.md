## The goal
- See what new episodes are available.
- Sync iMDB watchlist with media library
- Sync trakt.tv movie watchlist with media library

## Hardware
I acctually run the same setup on several machines, including a Raspberry Pi B and an Asrock ION 330. The Pi is on the slow side CPU wise, but the GPU handles HD video with no problem, so it does what it needs to do the most. I'll get a Pi 2 soon.

## Software
Well, Kodi of course. If you never heard of Kodi, you have probably heard of XBMC, which is what it used to be called.
